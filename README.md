# LocalAdvisor
Local Advisor is an application aimed at providing a platform for local recommendations to the user who uses it, making it possible to view and review multiple structures such as hotels, restaurants, museums, bars, nightclubs, and more. This multi-channel information system will present two software parts, one related to the mobile application intended for users, while the Desktop app for the Back-Office part is exclusively intended for administrators and DB managers.
